user_prompt:I love walking along the beach.
bot_joking:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
user_joking:The sound of the surf is my favorite part.
bot_elaboration:I do like the sounds at the beach, the surf but also the wind and seagulls, too.
user_joking:I love the seagulls, but sometimes they will come right down and steal your lunch!
bot_continuation:Yeah, they act like they own the place! Well, they are called seagulls and it is the sea, maybe they've got some sort of claim.
