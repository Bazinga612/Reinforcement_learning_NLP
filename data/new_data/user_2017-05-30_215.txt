Bot_none_15:04:09:Hi,Whasup?
User_none_15:04:09:I love walking along the beach.
Bot_Answer.joking_15:04:09:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
User_Answer.change_15:04:09:Oh yeah. It's like you take some of the beach home with you!
Bot_Answer.elaboration_15:04:09:If you get enough stuff you could even use it to make a beach scene in your backyard. Just don't take anything illegal. In some places it's illegal to take seashells.
User_Answer.elaboration_15:04:09:Yeah, it's hard to remember all the exact rules of each beach. But I appreciate how much beaches work to preserve their beauty, especially those in national parks.
Bot_Answer.elaboration_15:04:09:Yes, we need rules so we don't completely destroy the lovely environment of our beaches.
