Implementing Reinforcement Learning to find the best dialogue strategy for a conversation agent (chatbot) by search for maximum award.


### Deal with situations like
- user said somehting like "dfkjlskdfj"
- user repeat itself


### strategies improvement:
- "what's that?"
- "You need to be serious and say something sensible, I am not a bot to be taken light of"
- remove the bot utterence with words like "this", "that" because it usually doesn't fit into a conversation context
