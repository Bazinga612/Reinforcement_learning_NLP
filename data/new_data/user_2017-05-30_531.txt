Bot_none_15:04:12:Hi,Whasup?
User_none_15:04:12:I love walking along the beach.
Bot_Answer.joking_15:04:12:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
User_Answer.joking_15:04:12:The sound of the surf is my favorite part.
Bot_Answer.continuation_15:04:12:Oh the sound is so delightful especially when taking a nap.
User_Answer.continuation_15:04:12:It is, I love when the water is warm around 80 degrees.
Bot_Answer.elaboration_15:04:12:Every beach I go is always super cold when I first go in!
