Bot_none_15:04:11:Hi,Whasup?
User_none_15:04:11:I love walking along the beach.
Bot_Answer.joking_15:04:11:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
User_Answer.joking_15:04:11:The sound of the surf is my favorite part.
Bot_Answer.continuation_15:04:11:The sound of the surf is nice, there's a reason they use it for those machines that play relaxation sounds.
User_Answer.continuation_15:04:11:Yeah. It's kind of funny though, because there's so much movement and unpredictability with the waves, you'd think that would be associated with chaos and being all jumpy, not calmness and relaxing.
Bot_Answer.change_15:04:11:I just like relaxing by anything that is calm.
