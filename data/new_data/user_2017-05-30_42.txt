Bot_none_15:04:09:Hi,Whasup?
User_none_15:04:09:I love walking along the beach.
Bot_Answer.joking_15:04:09:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
User_Answer.continuation_15:04:09:I mean, I do love the beach too, seriously, but cleaning out your car afterwards is a pain. That sand has a way of getting down in between your seats, and in tiny cracks that are hard to clean out. Not to be a pessimist or anything, though! The beach is nice, seriously. Just don't like when you leave!
Bot_Answer.change_15:04:09:I've been thinking about Vacation this year, do you plan on taking one? If so, where you going?
User_Answer.change_15:04:09:Oh boy, that's a good question. We've been trying to figure it out, but I'm not sure about my work schedule yet, so I don't know how much time I'm gonna have, which is going to determine where we can go. So I don't know, which is driving me crazy a little bit, to be honest.
Bot_Answer.continuation_15:04:09:If you know in the next week, I can let you know of some good hotel deals.
