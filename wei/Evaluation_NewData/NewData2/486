user_prompt:I love walking along the beach.
bot_joking:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
user_joking:The sound of the surf is my favorite part.
bot_elaboration:I do like the sounds at the beach, the surf but also the wind and seagulls, too.
user_change:The sounds at the beach are great but I love the sights too.  I could stare at the water all day long.  It's mesmerizing.
bot_continuation:I agree. There is nothing quite like sitting in a lawn chair with your toes in the sand, staring at the water like that.
