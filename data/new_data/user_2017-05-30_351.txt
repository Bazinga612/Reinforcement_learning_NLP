Bot_none_15:04:11:Hi,Whasup?
User_none_15:04:11:I love walking along the beach.
Bot_Answer.joking_15:04:11:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
User_Answer.elaboration_15:04:11:I also like going to lakes.
Bot_Answer.joking_15:04:11:I wouldn't imagine getting sand in your shoes is very comfortable. But that's all part of the beach experience
User_Answer.joking_15:04:11:How close do you live to the beach?  Is it a long drive to get there?
Bot_Answer.elaboration_15:04:11:Sometimes, depending on traffic and time of day.
