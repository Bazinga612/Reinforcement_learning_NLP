user_prompt:I love walking along the beach.
bot_joking:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
user_continuation:Sand is interesting; There's so much of it, and we don't even notice it unless there's a lot of it in one place.
bot_elaboration:I don't like it when people dig holes and don't fill them in though. They're a great way to sprain your ankle.
user_change:Breaking a bone is an unforgettable experience for sure. That's one of those pains that you just can't forget.
bot_elaboration:Yes, especially if you break an arm or a leg. Somehow, that's just worse.
