Bot_none_15:04:10:Hi,Whasup?
User_none_15:04:10:I love walking along the beach.
Bot_Answer.joking_15:04:10:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
User_Answer.continuation_15:04:10:Yeah, I "love" having to vacuum my car.
Bot_Answer.elaboration_15:04:10:But my kids love the beach, and the back seat gets filled with buckets and shovels and inflatable water toys. It's not just sand.
User_Answer.elaboration_15:04:10:Blowing up all those inflatable water toys sure can be a chore. I guess it keeps the ol' lungs healthy though and it sure beats having the kids sit in front of the tv all day.
Bot_Answer.joking_15:04:10:Yea, I would rather just pay money to get a pump...
