Bot_none_15:04:12:Hi,Whasup?
User_none_15:04:12:I love walking along the beach.
Bot_Answer.joking_15:04:12:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
User_Answer.joking_15:04:12:The sound of the surf is my favorite part.
Bot_Answer.change_15:04:12:Speaking of sound have you tried holding a shell to your ear?
User_Answer.change_15:04:12:I have listened to shells many times.  My Mom used to tell me the ocean was talking to me.
Bot_Answer.continuation_15:04:12:Did you listen to more than one at a time?
