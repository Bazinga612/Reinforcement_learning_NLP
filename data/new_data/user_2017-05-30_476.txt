Bot_none_15:04:11:Hi,Whasup?
User_none_15:04:11:I love walking along the beach.
Bot_Answer.joking_15:04:11:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
User_Answer.joking_15:04:11:The sound of the surf is my favorite part.
Bot_Answer.continuation_15:04:11:The sound of the surf is nice, there's a reason they use it for those machines that play relaxation sounds.
User_Answer.continuation_15:04:11:If I wasn't concerned about getting too much sun I'd like to just lie down there and let it lull me to sleep.
Bot_Answer.joking_15:04:11:That's why you need to get someone to bury you in the sand first. And if it's someone nice they'll even do it above the high tide line.
