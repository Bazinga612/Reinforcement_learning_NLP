Bot_none_15:04:09:Hi,Whasup?
User_none_15:04:09:I love walking along the beach.
Bot_Answer.joking_15:04:09:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
User_Answer.change_15:04:09:Oh yeah. It's like you take some of the beach home with you!
Bot_Answer.elaboration_15:04:09:Yes, because you have the beach and the ocean seemingly to yourself.
User_Answer.elaboration_15:04:09:If I had my own private beach I think the best thing about it would be the chance to stride up to somebody and tell them to get off my island!
Bot_Answer.joking_15:04:09:No, you've got it backwards, if you've got your own island you don't let them leave unless they can survive you hunting them for sport.
