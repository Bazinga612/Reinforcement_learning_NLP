Bot_none_15:04:12:Hi,Whasup?
User_none_15:04:12:I love walking along the beach.
Bot_Answer.joking_15:04:12:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
User_Answer.joking_15:04:12:The sound of the surf is my favorite part.
Bot_Answer.continuation_15:04:12:Oh the sound is so delightful especially when taking a nap.
User_Answer.continuation_15:04:12:Yes, until you fall sound asleep and the waves crash down on you cause you did not hear them.
Bot_Answer.elaboration_15:04:12:Oh do you have trouble sleeping at times? I do too
