user_prompt:I love walking along the beach.
bot_joking:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
user_elaboration:I also like going to lakes.
bot_continuation:Me too I have gone to Lake Ontario a few times
user_change:I love lakes and nature but I hate the cold. Nothing gets to me more than cold weather because it feels like you're freezing from the inside out.
bot_elaboration:Yea, I don't like the cold either. It sucks!
