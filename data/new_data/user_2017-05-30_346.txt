Bot_none_15:04:11:Hi,Whasup?
User_none_15:04:11:I love walking along the beach.
Bot_Answer.joking_15:04:11:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
User_Answer.elaboration_15:04:11:I also like going to lakes.
Bot_Answer.elaboration_15:04:11:The beach reminds me of a peaceful place
User_Answer.elaboration_15:04:11:See, ever since I watched Jaws, the beach isn't quite the same for me, you know?
Bot_Answer.continuation_15:04:11:Please don't put that thought into my head.
