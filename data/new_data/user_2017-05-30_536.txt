Bot_none_15:04:12:Hi,Whasup?
User_none_15:04:12:I love walking along the beach.
Bot_Answer.joking_15:04:12:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
User_Answer.joking_15:04:12:The sound of the surf is my favorite part.
Bot_Answer.continuation_15:04:12:Oh the sound is so delightful especially when taking a nap.
User_Answer.continuation_15:04:12:Me, too although not when the sand is hot. That is why I walk near the water.
Bot_Answer.joking_15:04:12:Well they make this thing called flip flops...
