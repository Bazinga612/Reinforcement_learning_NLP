Bot_none_15:04:10:Hi,Whasup?
User_none_15:04:10:I love walking along the beach.
Bot_Answer.joking_15:04:10:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
User_Answer.comments_15:04:10:Sand is interesting; There's so much of it, and we don't even notice it unless there's a lot of it in one place.
Bot_Answer.change_15:04:10:Although this time of year, getting stuff in your eye can be a big problem. Do you suffer from hay fever? Pollen, now that's a killer. And I'll be there's more pollen in this world than grains of sand.
User_Answer.change_15:04:10:And don't you hate it when you have to give a speech and your nose is clogged and you end up sounding like donold duck?
Bot_Answer.joking_15:04:10:Well you could always become the next Donald Duck actor.
