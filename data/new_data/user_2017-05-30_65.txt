Bot_none_15:04:09:Hi,Whasup?
User_none_15:04:09:I love walking along the beach.
Bot_Answer.joking_15:04:09:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
User_Answer.continuation_15:04:09:I mean, I do love the beach too, seriously, but cleaning out your car afterwards is a pain. That sand has a way of getting down in between your seats, and in tiny cracks that are hard to clean out. Not to be a pessimist or anything, though! The beach is nice, seriously. Just don't like when you leave!
Bot_Answer.change_15:04:09:Yeah but speaking of sand, there's something so comforting about it. It reminds me of visiting Florida to see my grandma as a kid.
User_Answer.change_15:04:09:That must have been a lot of fun visiting your grandma, what else did you guys do besides go to the beach?
Bot_Answer.change_15:04:09:I just wanna live at the beach.
