user_prompt:I love walking along the beach.
bot_joking:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
user_elaboration:I also like going to lakes.
bot_joking:I wouldn't imagine getting sand in your shoes is very comfortable. But that's all part of the beach experience
user_change:How close do you live to the beach?  Is it a long drive to get there?
bot_joking:Nope, you can make it with a 3-wood.
