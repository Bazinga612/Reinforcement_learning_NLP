Bot_none_15:04:09:Hi,Whasup?
User_none_15:04:09:I love walking along the beach.
Bot_Answer.joking_15:04:09:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
User_Answer.change_15:04:09:Oh yeah. It's like you take some of the beach home with you!
Bot_Answer.continuation_15:04:09:My favorite time to walk the beach is early in the morning.
User_Answer.continuation_15:04:09:Me too. I love to smell the fresh ocean air and hear the waves crash. It's my favorite way to begin the day when I vacation in Florida.
Bot_Answer.joking_15:04:09:I'd never leave the beach, though, so I'd get permanently coated in salt.
