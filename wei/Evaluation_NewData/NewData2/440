user_prompt:I love walking along the beach.
bot_joking:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
user_joking:The sound of the surf is my favorite part.
bot_change:I prefer the ocean though. There's something magical about the cool water.
user_joking:I'm just worried that I'll get so relaxed that I fall asleep and wake up in Mexico!
bot_joking:Well if you wake up in Mexico at least there's plenty of new beaches to explore!
