Bot_none_15:04:11:Hi,Whasup?
User_none_15:04:11:I love walking along the beach.
Bot_Answer.joking_15:04:11:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
User_Answer.joking_15:04:11:The sound of the surf is my favorite part.
Bot_Answer.elaboration_15:04:11:I've been going to the beach since I was very young.
User_Answer.elaboration_15:04:11:Not me, I grew up in the midwest and we didn't have beaches, so this is all pretty new to me.
Bot_Answer.joking_15:04:11:Yea, did you guys ever leave the farm?
