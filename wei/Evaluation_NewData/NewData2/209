user_prompt:I love walking along the beach.
bot_joking:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
user_change:Oh yeah. It's like you take some of the beach home with you!
bot_elaboration:If you get enough stuff you could even use it to make a beach scene in your backyard. Just don't take anything illegal. In some places it's illegal to take seashells.
user_change:I do love when I can take stuff home from the beach too. One beach I was at sold tropical plants we could bring home, and it was so much more authentic than a generic beach scene.
bot_change:I just love being at the beach.
