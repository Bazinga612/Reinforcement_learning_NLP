Bot_none_15:04:12:Hi,Whasup?
User_none_15:04:12:I love walking along the beach.
Bot_Answer.joking_15:04:12:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
User_Answer.change_15:04:12:But the seagulls  pooping everywhere makes it a little gross.
Bot_Answer.elaboration_15:04:12:The sand feels good as it squishes between your toes.
User_Answer.elaboration_15:04:12:Sometime I think about maybe getting a boat, I bet that's fun, too.
Bot_Answer.continuation_15:04:12:I was on a boat once . The day after I got married. My one and only boat experience
