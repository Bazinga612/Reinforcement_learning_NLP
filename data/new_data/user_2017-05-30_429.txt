Bot_none_15:04:11:Hi,Whasup?
User_none_15:04:11:I love walking along the beach.
Bot_Answer.joking_15:04:11:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
User_Answer.joking_15:04:11:The sound of the surf is my favorite part.
Bot_Answer.change_15:04:11:I prefer the ocean though. There's something magical about the cool water.
User_Answer.change_15:04:11:It's especially blissful to let yourself slip under the surface and float with the waves.
Bot_Answer.change_15:04:11:I just love having the time to relax.
