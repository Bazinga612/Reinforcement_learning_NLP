user_prompt:I love walking along the beach.
bot_joking:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
user_change:Oh yeah. It's like you take some of the beach home with you!
bot_elaboration:If you get enough stuff you could even use it to make a beach scene in your backyard. Just don't take anything illegal. In some places it's illegal to take seashells.
user_continuation:Yeah, it's hard to remember all the exact rules of each beach. But I appreciate how much beaches work to preserve their beauty, especially those in national parks.
bot_change:Laws in natural areas vary so much from country to country. Sometimes you can't move a single thing off of the path!
