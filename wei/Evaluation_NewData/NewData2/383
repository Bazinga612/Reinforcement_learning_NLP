user_prompt:I love walking along the beach.
bot_joking:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
user_elaboration:I also like going to lakes.
bot_continuation:I actually prefer lakes to the ocean. Salt water makes you feel so sticky when you dry off.
user_continuation:I have so many good memories of being out on lakes. I enjoyed extreme water sports such as wake boarding and skiing so I spent a lot of time on a ski boat on the water.
bot_elaboration:Yea, sometimes its nice drifting with the water.
