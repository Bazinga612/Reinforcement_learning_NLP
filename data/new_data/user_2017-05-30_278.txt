Bot_none_15:04:10:Hi,Whasup?
User_none_15:04:10:I love walking along the beach.
Bot_Answer.joking_15:04:10:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
User_Answer.continuation_15:04:10:Yeah, I "love" having to vacuum my car.
Bot_Answer.elaboration_15:04:10:Every time I'm standing on the beach at sunset though, I see why people do it. Even with the sand in your stuff and on your clothes it's still a magical experience.
User_Answer.elaboration_15:04:10:Its one of the reasons why a lot of people get married on the beach.  The pictures are amazing: the couple's silhouette against crashing waves and white sand . . . it truly is something else.
Bot_Answer.continuation_15:04:10:They say that all life began in the sea, I wonder if that has anything to do with why it seems so fascinating.
