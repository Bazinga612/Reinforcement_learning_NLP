user_prompt:I love walking along the beach.
bot_joking:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
user_elaboration:I also like going to lakes.
bot_continuation:Lakes are pretty nice, especially if you can go out on a boat.
user_continuation:Yeah, I like boating, too. I try and do it a lot during the summer, just go out to the lake and relax and spend time with friends or alone or whatever. Always a nice day.
bot_joking:It's also nice for spending time with enemies, one quick push and they're over the side never to be seen again.
