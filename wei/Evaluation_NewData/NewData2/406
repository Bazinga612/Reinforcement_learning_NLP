user_prompt:I love walking along the beach.
bot_joking:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
user_elaboration:I also like going to lakes.
bot_continuation:Lakes are pretty nice, especially if you can go out on a boat.
user_elaboration:Yeah, I love boating. I just love the water in general, actually. I like boating, canoing, wake-boarding, scuba diving. Anything in the water, I'm cool with it.
bot_continuation:Do you still enjoy tubing? You used to go all the time.
