user_prompt:I love walking along the beach.
bot_joking:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
user_continuation:I mean, I do love the beach too, seriously, but cleaning out your car afterwards is a pain. That sand has a way of getting down in between your seats, and in tiny cracks that are hard to clean out. Not to be a pessimist or anything, though! The beach is nice, seriously. Just don't like when you leave!
bot_change:Yeah but speaking of sand, there's something so comforting about it. It reminds me of visiting Florida to see my grandma as a kid.
user_change:I also like to visit the towns along Lake Michigan, they lake is so big it reminds me of the ocean.
bot_joking:Last time I went with my little niece and my sister. The child kept calling it Lake Missy-Gone.
