bot_joking:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
user_joking:The sound of the surf is my favorite part.
bot_elaboration:I've been going to the beach since I was very young.

bot_change:Everybody has to get old someday.
