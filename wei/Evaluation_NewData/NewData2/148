user_prompt:I love walking along the beach.
bot_joking:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
user_joking:Speaking of cars, I'm thinking of getting a new one.
bot_elaboration:I like having a new car, but I hate shopping for them, and I especially hate dealing with the sales people.
user_joking:Nothing is worse than to show up at a dealership and have some man talking a million miles an hour in your face! They could ask me to trade in my first born child and I'd probably agree before I realized what they asked me.
bot_joking:Yea, they talk faster than they think.
