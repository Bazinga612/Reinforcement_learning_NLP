Bot_none_15:04:09:Hi,Whasup?
User_none_15:04:09:I love walking along the beach.
Bot_Answer.joking_15:04:09:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
User_Answer.joking_15:04:09:Speaking of cars, I'm thinking of getting a new one.
Bot_Answer.elaboration_15:04:09:I like having a new car, but I hate shopping for them, and I especially hate dealing with the sales people.
User_Answer.elaboration_15:04:09:I don't mind boat shopping as much though. There's just something engaging about the diversity of boat models that makes shopping for them a lot more enjoyable.
Bot_Answer.change_15:04:09:I love shopping for cars.
