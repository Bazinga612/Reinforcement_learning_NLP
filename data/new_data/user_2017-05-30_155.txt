Bot_none_15:04:09:Hi,Whasup?
User_none_15:04:09:I love walking along the beach.
Bot_Answer.joking_15:04:09:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
User_Answer.change_15:04:09:Oh yeah. It's like you take some of the beach home with you!
Bot_Answer.change_15:04:09:Hey, I found a gold coin once while walking on the beach.
User_Answer.change_15:04:09:Wow. I sometimes see people with metal detectors there, but I figured that nobody ever actually finds anything worthwhile.
Bot_Answer.elaboration_15:04:09:Anything you do in nature takes a lot of dedication. I admire how hard people who treasure hunt work on finding stuff on the beach.
