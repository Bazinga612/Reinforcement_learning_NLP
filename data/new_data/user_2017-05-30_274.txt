Bot_none_15:04:10:Hi,Whasup?
User_none_15:04:10:I love walking along the beach.
Bot_Answer.joking_15:04:10:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
User_Answer.continuation_15:04:10:Yeah, I "love" having to vacuum my car.
Bot_Answer.elaboration_15:04:10:Every time I'm standing on the beach at sunset though, I see why people do it. Even with the sand in your stuff and on your clothes it's still a magical experience.
User_Answer.elaboration_15:04:10:Speaking of sunsets, have you ever seen the green flash? During perfect conditions, right before the sun completely sets, there's a bright green flash.
Bot_Answer.continuation_15:04:10:I have not seen a bright green flash, but I have seen pink clouds.
