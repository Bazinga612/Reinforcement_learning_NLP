user_prompt:I love walking along the beach.
bot_joking:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
user_elaboration:The moment I drove back, and opened the car door after getting home sand just started pouring out, castles and all. There were even a few crabs, and some fish. Water and all. I'm sure I must've brought back at least a quarter of the beach with me. On the plus side, now I no longer have to go out to go to the beach. I just open the front door.
bot_continuation:The way that the salt eats away at your car and all the cleaning you have to do of the seats and the carpets makes you wonder.
user_change:My car has rust, I have to find a repair shop.
bot_elaboration:Where's the closest repair shop?
