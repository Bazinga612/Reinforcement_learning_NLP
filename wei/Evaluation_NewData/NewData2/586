user_prompt:I love walking along the beach.
bot_joking:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
user_continuation:On the plus side, after a few trips you can make your kids a sandbox.
bot_change:Maybe I should build the kids a tree house. We've got a big tree in the back yard with some nice large low-hanging branches. How hard do you think that would be?
user_change:I love owning houses with wooded backyards. Nothing feels better than to lay out under a tree and sun yourself on a warm day.
bot_continuation:I agree! Its the most relaxing and enjoyable feeling.
