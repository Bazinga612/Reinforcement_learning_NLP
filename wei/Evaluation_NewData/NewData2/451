bot_joking:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
user_joking:The sound of the surf is my favorite part.
bot_elaboration:I've been going to the beach since I was very young.
user_elaboration:Not me, I grew up in the midwest and we didn't have beaches, so this is all pretty new to me.
bot_elaboration:Yea, you had more farms than anything then.
