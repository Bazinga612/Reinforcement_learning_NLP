user_prompt:I love walking along the beach.
bot_joking:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
user_joking:The sound of the surf is my favorite part.
bot_change:I prefer the ocean though. There's something magical about the cool water.
user_change:Cruises are another way to enjoy the ocean. Between the view and the free food I'm not sure why anyone would fly to an island destination.
bot_change:I love to travel anywhere that I can.
