Bot_none_15:04:12:Hi,Whasup?
User_none_15:04:12:I love walking along the beach.
Bot_Answer.joking_15:04:12:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
User_Answer.joking_15:04:12:The sound of the surf is my favorite part.
Bot_Answer.elaboration_15:04:12:Well the surf actually helps keep the sand nice and clean.
User_Answer.elaboration_15:04:12:I love walking on the beach too. I especially like to find shells.
Bot_Answer.continuation_15:04:12:That's awesome! I love it when I find a shell I can hear the ocean through.
