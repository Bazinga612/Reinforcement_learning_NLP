Bot_none_15:04:11:Hi,Whasup?
User_none_15:04:11:I love walking along the beach.
Bot_Answer.joking_15:04:11:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
User_Answer.joking_15:04:11:The sound of the surf is my favorite part.
Bot_Answer.elaboration_15:04:11:I've been going to the beach since I was very young.
User_Answer.elaboration_15:04:11:Was that back when you crawled out of the primordial ooze?
Bot_Answer.elaboration_15:04:11:Yes, but I have to say my favorite beach day is when it is kind of foggy out and you can hear fog horns in the distance . The surf is crashing and there is barely anyone around. It is so peaceful and almost zen-like.
