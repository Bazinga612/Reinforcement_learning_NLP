Bot_none_15:04:11:Hi,Whasup?
User_none_15:04:11:I love walking along the beach.
Bot_Answer.joking_15:04:11:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
User_Answer.elaboration_15:04:11:I also like going to lakes.
Bot_Answer.continuation_15:04:11:Lakes are pretty nice, especially if you can go out on a boat.
User_Answer.continuation_15:04:11:Yeah, I like outdoor things in general. I'm a big fan of camping out, too. Not many people are, it seems, but I love a night in the woods in a tent, campfire, the whole nine yards.
Bot_Answer.continuation_15:04:11:Where is your favorite place to camp?
