Bot_none_15:04:11:Hi,Whasup?
User_none_15:04:11:I love walking along the beach.
Bot_Answer.joking_15:04:11:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
User_Answer.elaboration_15:04:11:I also like going to lakes.
Bot_Answer.continuation_15:04:11:Lakes are pretty nice, especially if you can go out on a boat.
User_Answer.continuation_15:04:11:Yeah, that's good thinking there. I was wondering why, when I go out without a boat, I always get drenched. That really had me stumped, but wow, I think you figured it out. You're a smart one, huh?
Bot_Answer.joking_15:04:11:Lake water isn't the cleanest ya know?
