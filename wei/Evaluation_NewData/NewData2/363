user_prompt:I love walking along the beach.
bot_joking:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
user_elaboration:I also like going to lakes.
bot_joking:I wouldn't imagine getting sand in your shoes is very comfortable. But that's all part of the beach experience
user_joking:Sand in your shoes and a possible sunburn are part of the experience, neither of which makes it sound that fun!
bot_elaboration:Sunburns always turn into tans though.
