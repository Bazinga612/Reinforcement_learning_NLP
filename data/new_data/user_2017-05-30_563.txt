Bot_none_15:04:12:Hi,Whasup?
User_none_15:04:12:I love walking along the beach.
Bot_Answer.joking_15:04:12:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
User_Answer.change_15:04:12:But the seagulls  pooping everywhere makes it a little gross.
Bot_Answer.elaboration_15:04:12:The sand feels good as it squishes between your toes.
User_Answer.elaboration_15:04:12:Ugh, now I'm thinking about what else squishes between my toes.
Bot_Answer.elaboration_15:04:12:Its sometimes amazing feeling the warm sand hit my toes.
