user_prompt:I love walking along the beach.
bot_joking:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
user_joking:The sound of the surf is my favorite part.
bot_elaboration:Well the surf actually helps keep the sand nice and clean.
user_continuation:I love walking on the beach too. I especially like to find shells.
bot_joking:I'm always so worried that a crab will be in a seashell I come across, and it will bite my finger off or something!
