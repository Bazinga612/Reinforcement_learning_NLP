Bot_none_15:04:09:Hi,Whasup?
User_none_15:04:09:I love walking along the beach.
Bot_Answer.joking_15:04:09:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
User_Answer.continuation_15:04:09:I mean, I do love the beach too, seriously, but cleaning out your car afterwards is a pain. That sand has a way of getting down in between your seats, and in tiny cracks that are hard to clean out. Not to be a pessimist or anything, though! The beach is nice, seriously. Just don't like when you leave!
Bot_Answer.change_15:04:09:I've been thinking about Vacation this year, do you plan on taking one? If so, where you going?
User_Answer.change_15:04:09:Oh yeah, I'm scheduling a trip around the world even as we speak. The only thing standing in the way is the fact that I've already used all my vacation days for my brother's stupid wedding, so no, my round-the-world trip is canceled, thanks for bringing it up.
Bot_Answer.elaboration_15:04:09:Why would you use up all your vacation days with a trip planned?
