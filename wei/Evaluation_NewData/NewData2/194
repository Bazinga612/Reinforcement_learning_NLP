user_prompt:I love walking along the beach.
bot_joking:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
user_change:Oh yeah. It's like you take some of the beach home with you!
bot_change:When winter comes, you can decorate your backyard to look like a ski resort! No sand required for that.
user_change:You totally could. Which reminds me, are you going away at Christmastime this year? I was wondering if you could dog sit for me if you're going to be in town.
bot_continuation:I am actually going to be home this Christmas. I'd love to help out. How is old Rufus?
