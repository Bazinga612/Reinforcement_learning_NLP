Bot_none_15:04:11:Hi,Whasup?
User_none_15:04:11:I love walking along the beach.
Bot_Answer.joking_15:04:11:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
User_Answer.elaboration_15:04:11:I also like going to lakes.
Bot_Answer.continuation_15:04:11:Me too I have gone to Lake Ontario a few times
User_Answer.continuation_15:04:11:I'd love to go there in the summer to experience the beauty of the open woods but I'd hate the winters.
Bot_Answer.elaboration_15:04:11:Sometimes the snow can be beautiful, but annoying.
