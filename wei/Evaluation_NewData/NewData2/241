user_prompt:I love walking along the beach.
bot_joking:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
user_continuation:Sand is interesting; There's so much of it, and we don't even notice it unless there's a lot of it in one place.
bot_elaboration:I don't like it when people dig holes and don't fill them in though. They're a great way to sprain your ankle.
user_continuation:Sometimes I'm so civic minded that I'll go ahead and fill them in. Nothing is more awkward than to be on your hands and knees as an adult covering over some childs sandcastle.
bot_change:Speaking of holes, these moles keep digging in my backyard. It's driving me nuts.
