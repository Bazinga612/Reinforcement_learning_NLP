Bot_none_15:04:09:Hi,Whasup?
User_none_15:04:09:I love walking along the beach.
Bot_Answer.joking_15:04:09:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
User_Answer.joking_15:04:09:Speaking of cars, I'm thinking of getting a new one.
Bot_Answer.joking_15:04:09:It feels like the fast talking salesmen are always trying to get me to buy something I didn't think I wanted.
User_Answer.joking_15:04:09:It is probably better to do the options checking for the model you like before going to the dealership.
Bot_Answer.elaboration_15:04:09:You might wanna look up many cars before going to a dealer. I agree
