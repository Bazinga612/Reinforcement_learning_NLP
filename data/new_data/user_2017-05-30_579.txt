Bot_none_15:04:12:Hi,Whasup?
User_none_15:04:12:I love walking along the beach.
Bot_Answer.joking_15:04:12:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
User_Answer.change_15:04:12:But the seagulls  pooping everywhere makes it a little gross.
Bot_Answer.joking_15:04:12:People are always trying to say how beautiful and majestic nature is, but I estimate that it's about 30% poop.
User_Answer.joking_15:04:12:I would say that most of it  is beautiful although there are areas that could be classified as poop.
Bot_Answer.elaboration_15:04:12:Well, when you think about it... the ocean is also full of poop. Fish poop too you know.
