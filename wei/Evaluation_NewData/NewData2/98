bot_joking:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
user_joking:Speaking of cars, I'm thinking of getting a new one.

user_change:Take a look in the local newspaper classifieds. Sometimes you can find a decent private sale and even bring it to a friend or mechanic you trust to take a close look or use a place like Carfax where you can get detailed previous ownership details.
bot_continuation:You really do have to try hard to find the best deal when searching for a new car.
