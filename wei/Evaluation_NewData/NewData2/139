user_prompt:I love walking along the beach.
bot_joking:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
user_joking:Speaking of cars, I'm thinking of getting a new one.
bot_elaboration:I like having a new car, but I hate shopping for them, and I especially hate dealing with the sales people.
user_continuation:The decision is always difficult because there's just so many options to choose from. I always wish I could skip the buying part and just find out what I end up picking.
bot_elaboration:I think buying is the best part. Its kinda like gambling.
