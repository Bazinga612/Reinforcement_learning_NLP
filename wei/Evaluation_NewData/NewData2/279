user_prompt:I love walking along the beach.
bot_joking:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
user_continuation:Yeah, I "love" having to vacuum my car.
bot_elaboration:Every time I'm standing on the beach at sunset though, I see why people do it. Even with the sand in your stuff and on your clothes it's still a magical experience.
user_continuation:Its one of the reasons why a lot of people get married on the beach.  The pictures are amazing: the couple's silhouette against crashing waves and white sand . . . it truly is something else.
bot_elaboration:Sunset at the beach is very poetic, it's the time between day and night, at the place between the land and ocean.
