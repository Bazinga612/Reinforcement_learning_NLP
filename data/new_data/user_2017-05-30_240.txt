Bot_none_15:04:10:Hi,Whasup?
User_none_15:04:10:I love walking along the beach.
Bot_Answer.joking_15:04:10:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
User_Answer.comments_15:04:10:Sand is interesting; There's so much of it, and we don't even notice it unless there's a lot of it in one place.
Bot_Answer.elaboration_15:04:10:I don't like it when people dig holes and don't fill them in though. They're a great way to sprain your ankle.
User_Answer.elaboration_15:04:10:Breaking a bone is an unforgettable experience for sure. That's one of those pains that you just can't forget.
Bot_Answer.joking_15:04:10:It's a wonderful memory, that's why you can't forget!
