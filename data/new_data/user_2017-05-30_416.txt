Bot_none_15:04:11:Hi,Whasup?
User_none_15:04:11:I love walking along the beach.
Bot_Answer.joking_15:04:11:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
User_Answer.elaboration_15:04:11:I also like going to lakes.
Bot_Answer.elaboration_15:04:11:Lakes always remind me of the times my Dad took me fishing.
User_Answer.elaboration_15:04:11:Fishing was more about just spending time with my Dad than about bringing in the big haul.
Bot_Answer.joking_15:04:11:You hated fish but ate more than either of us.
