user_prompt:I love walking along the beach.
bot_joking:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
user_continuation:I mean, I do love the beach too, seriously, but cleaning out your car afterwards is a pain. That sand has a way of getting down in between your seats, and in tiny cracks that are hard to clean out. Not to be a pessimist or anything, though! The beach is nice, seriously. Just don't like when you leave!
bot_change:I've been thinking about Vacation this year, do you plan on taking one? If so, where you going?
user_elaboration:I'm definitely going to take one. I get a little stir crazy if I don't. Last year, when it got to be around this time of year, I found myself getting so tense all the time, and it finally occurred to me that I was long overdue for some time off. It was affecting my mood in a really significant way.
bot_continuation:Sometimes you need a vacation for your mental health.
