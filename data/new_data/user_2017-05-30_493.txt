Bot_none_15:04:12:Hi,Whasup?
User_none_15:04:12:I love walking along the beach.
Bot_Answer.joking_15:04:12:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
User_Answer.joking_15:04:12:The sound of the surf is my favorite part.
Bot_Answer.elaboration_15:04:12:I do like the sounds at the beach, the surf but also the wind and seagulls, too.
User_Answer.elaboration_15:04:12:Do you have any beach vacations planned this year?  They are always so relaxing.
Bot_Answer.change_15:04:12:No, but we've got something nice planned for Christmas!
