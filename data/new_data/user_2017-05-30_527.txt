Bot_none_15:04:12:Hi,Whasup?
User_none_15:04:12:I love walking along the beach.
Bot_Answer.joking_15:04:12:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
User_Answer.joking_15:04:12:The sound of the surf is my favorite part.
Bot_Answer.change_15:04:12:Speaking of sound have you tried holding a shell to your ear?
User_Answer.change_15:04:12:How about all the sand in the car after the beach?  That's no fun at all!
Bot_Answer.elaboration_15:04:12:I agree about all the sand, that's why I always have a shop vac at the ready when I get home.
