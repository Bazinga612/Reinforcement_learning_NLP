Bot_none_15:04:12:Hi,Whasup?
User_none_15:04:12:I love walking along the beach.
Bot_Answer.joking_15:04:12:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
User_Answer.joking_15:04:12:The sound of the surf is my favorite part.
Bot_Answer.joking_15:04:12:Yeah, "Those waves are gnarly, dude." No, wait, that's the sound of the surfers.
User_Answer.joking_15:04:12:I'd like to walk around here more, but there's nowhere that you can get away from the sound of traffic, so I can never fully relax.
Bot_Answer.joking_15:04:12:I wonder what the people who invented cars would think if they knew we need them so we can get far enough away from other cars to walk in peace.
