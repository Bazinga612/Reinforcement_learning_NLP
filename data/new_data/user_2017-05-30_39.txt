Bot_none_15:04:09:Hi,Whasup?
User_none_15:04:09:I love walking along the beach.
Bot_Answer.joking_15:04:09:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
User_Answer.continuation_15:04:09:I mean, I do love the beach too, seriously, but cleaning out your car afterwards is a pain. That sand has a way of getting down in between your seats, and in tiny cracks that are hard to clean out. Not to be a pessimist or anything, though! The beach is nice, seriously. Just don't like when you leave!
Bot_Answer.change_15:04:09:I've been thinking about Vacation this year, do you plan on taking one? If so, where you going?
User_Answer.change_15:04:09:I don't know, I'm arguing with my family about it, so I don't even want to talk about it. What I really want to do is take a month off and work on my book. But I don't think I'm going to be able to do that. Let me tell you what I was thinking about in terms of the next chapter, though, okay?
Bot_Answer.elaboration_15:04:09:Sure, it sounds like you  really have a great idea of what you're doing.
