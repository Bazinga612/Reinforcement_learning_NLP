Bot_none_15:04:11:Hi,Whasup?
User_none_15:04:11:I love walking along the beach.
Bot_Answer.joking_15:04:11:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
User_Answer.elaboration_15:04:11:I also like going to lakes.
Bot_Answer.continuation_15:04:11:Lakes are pretty nice, especially if you can go out on a boat.
User_Answer.continuation_15:04:11:Yeah, I like boating, too. I try and do it a lot during the summer, just go out to the lake and relax and spend time with friends or alone or whatever. Always a nice day.
Bot_Answer.elaboration_15:04:11:It's so peaceful on a boat, kind of like a separate world you can step onto for a little while.
