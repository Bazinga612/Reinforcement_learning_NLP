### Deal with situations like
- user said somehting like "dfkjlskdfj"
- user repeat itself


### strategies improvement:
- "what's that?"
- "You need to be serious and say something sensible, I am not a bot to be taken light of"
- remove the bot utterence with words like "this", "that" because it usually doesn't fit into a conversation context
- have to be only one book series/movie, suggest GOT because new season is coming
