user_prompt:I love walking along the beach.
bot_joking:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
user_change:Oh yeah. It's like you take some of the beach home with you!
bot_continuation:My favorite time to walk the beach is early in the morning.
user_change:I've never actually been to the beach before noon, but I really like to run around the lake near my house in the morning. It's good exercise, and I get in touch with nature a bit.
bot_elaboration:Exercise is always fun! I like it!
