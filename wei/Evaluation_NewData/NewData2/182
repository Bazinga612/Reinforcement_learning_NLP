user_prompt:I love walking along the beach.
bot_joking:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
user_change:Oh yeah. It's like you take some of the beach home with you!
bot_elaboration:Yes, because you have the beach and the ocean seemingly to yourself.
user_continuation:I've always wished that I could own a private beach. I hate the crowds on the beach and the fact that you can never set up where you want.
bot_continuation:That's not bad. Also don't have to worry about throwing a football into another group or having someone kick sand on you.
