Bot_none_15:04:09:Hi,Whasup?
User_none_15:04:09:I love walking along the beach.
Bot_Answer.joking_15:04:09:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
User_Answer.continuation_15:04:09:I mean, I do love the beach too, seriously, but cleaning out your car afterwards is a pain. That sand has a way of getting down in between your seats, and in tiny cracks that are hard to clean out. Not to be a pessimist or anything, though! The beach is nice, seriously. Just don't like when you leave!
Bot_Answer.elaboration_15:04:09:Right, there's nothing fun about cleaning out the car after the beach, but maybe it'd be a good idea to rinse off as best as we can before getting in and lay down towels over the seats?
User_Answer.elaboration_15:04:09:It always ends up making the car smelly because it soaks in and it's difficult to get out. If it's really bad you might just have to get the interior detailed.
Bot_Answer.change_15:04:09:I'll find something to get the smell out. I hear vinegar mixed with peroxide is a good cleaner and deodorizer.
