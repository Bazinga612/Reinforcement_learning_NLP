user_prompt:I love walking along the beach.
bot_joking:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
user_change:Oh yeah. It's like you take some of the beach home with you!
bot_change:Hey, I found a gold coin once while walking on the beach.
user_elaboration:Wow. I sometimes see people with metal detectors there, but I figured that nobody ever actually finds anything worthwhile.
bot_joking:You know, no one finds anything worthwhile, but it's still a better shot than the lottery, huh?
