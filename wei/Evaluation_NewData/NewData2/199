user_prompt:I love walking along the beach.
bot_joking:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
user_change:Oh yeah. It's like you take some of the beach home with you!
bot_change:When winter comes, you can decorate your backyard to look like a ski resort! No sand required for that.
user_continuation:I suppose you could. I've never gone quite that far, but I do love getting my house and yard all festive looking at Christmas time. I like to go overboard, to be honest.
bot_elaboration:I like to do decorations as well. Especially Hanukkah ones.
