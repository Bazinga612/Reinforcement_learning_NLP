Bot_none_15:04:11:Hi,Whasup?
User_none_15:04:11:I love walking along the beach.
Bot_Answer.joking_15:04:11:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
User_Answer.elaboration_15:04:11:I also like going to lakes.
Bot_Answer.change_15:04:11:Actually, lakes can have some weird stuff in them. Have you ever stepped on anything squirmy in the lake? I hear they've got eels and bloodsuckers, icky.
User_Answer.change_15:04:11:I really like water skiing when I visit the lake.  It scary and fun at the same time.
Bot_Answer.continuation_15:04:11:Yea, it is thrilling and especially fun if you're good.
