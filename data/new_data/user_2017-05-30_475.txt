Bot_none_15:04:11:Hi,Whasup?
User_none_15:04:11:I love walking along the beach.
Bot_Answer.joking_15:04:11:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
User_Answer.joking_15:04:11:The sound of the surf is my favorite part.
Bot_Answer.continuation_15:04:11:The sound of the surf is nice, there's a reason they use it for those machines that play relaxation sounds.
User_Answer.continuation_15:04:11:If I wasn't concerned about getting too much sun I'd like to just lie down there and let it lull me to sleep.
Bot_Answer.elaboration_15:04:11:Yeah. And when I'm applying sunscreen it tends to just make me more anxious because it gets me all paranoid about skin cancer.
