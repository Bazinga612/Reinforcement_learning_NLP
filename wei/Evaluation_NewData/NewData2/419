user_prompt:I love walking along the beach.
bot_joking:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
user_elaboration:I also like going to lakes.
bot_elaboration:Lakes always remind me of the times my Dad took me fishing.
user_elaboration:We would sit for hours gently rocking back and forth in a small fishing boat.
bot_elaboration:We had a little rowboat that we would take sometimes. Honestly I had more fun rowing the boat than I did with the fishing.
