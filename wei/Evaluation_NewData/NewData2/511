user_prompt:I love walking along the beach.
bot_joking:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
user_joking:The sound of the surf is my favorite part.
bot_joking:Yeah, "Those waves are gnarly, dude." No, wait, that's the sound of the surfers.
user_elaboration:Yeah. Sometimes the biggest problem with the beach is all the other people who like the beach.
bot_elaboration:Yea, I hate a busy beach.
