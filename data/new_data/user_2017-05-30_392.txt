Bot_none_15:04:11:Hi,Whasup?
User_none_15:04:11:I love walking along the beach.
Bot_Answer.joking_15:04:11:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
User_Answer.elaboration_15:04:11:I also like going to lakes.
Bot_Answer.elaboration_15:04:11:You can do a lot of the same things in a lake as in the ocean, except maybe surfing. If the lake is big enough, you can go sail boating, and they have these new boards now you can stand on and paddle your way around.
User_Answer.elaboration_15:04:11:Paddle boards?  Those look like a lot of fun.  We should try to find some place we can rent a couple.
Bot_Answer.joking_15:04:11:Yeah right I would not be able to stand on a paddle board for more than a minute.
