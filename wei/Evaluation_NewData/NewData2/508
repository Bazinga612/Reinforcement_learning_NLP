user_prompt:I love walking along the beach.
bot_joking:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
user_joking:The sound of the surf is my favorite part.
bot_joking:Yeah, "Those waves are gnarly, dude." No, wait, that's the sound of the surfers.
user_continuation:Hehe. Some of them are nice to look at, though.
bot_joking:Yea, I love hearing the same noise over and over.
