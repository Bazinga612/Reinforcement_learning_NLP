user_prompt:I love walking along the beach.
bot_joking:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
user_continuation:Yeah, I "love" having to vacuum my car.
bot_continuation:I love vacuuming my car too, haha, but it's worth it for all the fun we've had.
user_joking:During the summer I would turn feral: hair wild, face tanned dark, and the soles of my feet hard as leather.
bot_change:Its fun being able to enjoy the summer
