user_prompt:I love walking along the beach.
bot_joking:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
user_change:Oh yeah. It's like you take some of the beach home with you!
bot_continuation:My favorite time to walk the beach is early in the morning.
user_elaboration:Me too. I love to smell the fresh ocean air and hear the waves crash. It's my favorite way to begin the day when I vacation in Florida.
bot_change:If you wanted to we could plan a vacation to the ocean this summer. We could share a cottage.
