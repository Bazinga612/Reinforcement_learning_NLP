Bot_none_15:04:11:Hi,Whasup?
User_none_15:04:11:I love walking along the beach.
Bot_Answer.joking_15:04:11:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
User_Answer.elaboration_15:04:11:I also like going to lakes.
Bot_Answer.continuation_15:04:11:I actually prefer lakes to the ocean. Salt water makes you feel so sticky when you dry off.
User_Answer.continuation_15:04:11:I love how smooth lakes are. They allow for a lot of unique water activities such as wake surfing.
Bot_Answer.joking_15:04:11:I like everything smooth. Ya know
