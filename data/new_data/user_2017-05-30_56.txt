Bot_none_15:04:09:Hi,Whasup?
User_none_15:04:09:I love walking along the beach.
Bot_Answer.joking_15:04:09:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
User_Answer.continuation_15:04:09:I mean, I do love the beach too, seriously, but cleaning out your car afterwards is a pain. That sand has a way of getting down in between your seats, and in tiny cracks that are hard to clean out. Not to be a pessimist or anything, though! The beach is nice, seriously. Just don't like when you leave!
Bot_Answer.elaboration_15:04:09:I remember two years ago we went to Virginia Beach, and we had sand in our car for six months after that.
User_Answer.elaboration_15:04:09:I know what you mean, you can clean your car forever and the sand just won't come out.  I have found that the best thing to do is try a commercial vacuum at the car wash.  Have you tried that?
Bot_Answer.joking_15:04:09:I'm actually thinking of going in the other direction and just letting it build up, and then when there's so much sand that there's not room for people anymore we'll know it's time to trade the car in for a new one.
