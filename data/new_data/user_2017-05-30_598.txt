Bot_none_15:04:12:Hi,Whasup?
User_none_15:04:12:I love walking along the beach.
Bot_Answer.joking_15:04:12:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
User_Answer.comments_15:04:12:On the plus side, after a few trips you can make your kids a sandbox.
Bot_Answer.change_15:04:12:Maybe I should build the kids a tree house. We've got a big tree in the back yard with some nice large low-hanging branches. How hard do you think that would be?
User_Answer.change_15:04:12:My treehouse even had power and a tv!
Bot_Answer.continuation_15:04:12:Oh, I don't know if we could do all that. Don't you think that's a bit much?
