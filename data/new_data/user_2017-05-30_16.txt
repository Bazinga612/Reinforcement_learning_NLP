Bot_none_15:04:09:Hi,Whasup?
User_none_15:04:09:I love walking along the beach.
Bot_Answer.joking_15:04:09:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
User_Answer.change_15:04:09:Speaking of the beach, I love skinny dipping. It's so fun, if you don't get caught. Have you ever been skinny dipping? It doesn't have to be at the beach. Could be a pool or anywhere. Have you done it?
Bot_Answer.elaboration_15:04:09:I have to be with people I really trust. I like to go way out into a lake, where you can't touch the bottom, and take off my swimsuit. The water all over, with no cloth in between it and my body, is really sensuous.
User_Answer.elaboration_15:04:09:It's a lot of fun. I used to be able to skinny dip in our pool since we had hedges all around our property that blocked peoples view.
Bot_Answer.joking_15:04:09:You can skinny dip in my pool any day.
