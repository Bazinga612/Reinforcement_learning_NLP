user_prompt:I love walking along the beach.
bot_joking:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
user_joking:The sound of the surf is my favorite part.
bot_elaboration:I do like the sounds at the beach, the surf but also the wind and seagulls, too.
user_continuation:All of the sounds make for the perfect beach day, I also like looking out into the water and watching the sailboats.
bot_change:I find beaches can be a bit crowded sometimes. I've never relaxed by a lake, have you ever done that?
