user_prompt:I love walking along the beach.
bot_joking:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
user_continuation:Sand is interesting; There's so much of it, and we don't even notice it unless there's a lot of it in one place.
bot_joking:In the sand is also a nice place to get romantic.
user_joking:It's unfortunate but all the fairy tale scenes that we laugh at in movies speak to us as people. I think that no matter how much you might claim that romantic movies aren't for you that everyone enjoys it when those situations actually happen.
bot_joking:Yea, I get in romantic situations all the time. Just saying
