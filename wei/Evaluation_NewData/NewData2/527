user_prompt:I love walking along the beach.
bot_joking:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
user_joking:The sound of the surf is my favorite part.
bot_change:Speaking of sound have you tried holding a shell to your ear?
user_joking:How about all the sand in the car after the beach?  That's no fun at all!
bot_elaboration:I agree about all the sand, that's why I always have a shop vac at the ready when I get home.
