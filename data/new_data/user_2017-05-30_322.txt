Bot_none_15:04:11:Hi,Whasup?
User_none_15:04:11:I love walking along the beach.
Bot_Answer.joking_15:04:11:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
User_Answer.elaboration_15:04:11:I also like going to lakes.
Bot_Answer.continuation_15:04:11:Me too I have gone to Lake Ontario a few times
User_Answer.continuation_15:04:11:I love lakes and nature but I hate the cold. Nothing gets to me more than cold weather because it feels like you're freezing from the inside out.
Bot_Answer.continuation_15:04:11:yea, the only  good part about the cold is that you can put on a Jacket.
