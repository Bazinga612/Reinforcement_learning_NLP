user_prompt:I love walking along the beach.
bot_joking:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
user_elaboration:I also like going to lakes.
bot_change:Actually, lakes can have some weird stuff in them. Have you ever stepped on anything squirmy in the lake? I hear they've got eels and bloodsuckers, icky.
user_continuation:I have stepped on some weird creatures in the lake, but nothing scary enough to make me stop swimming.
bot_continuation:I've stepped on a few things that squishes before, but nothing that I could tell what it was. I'm more afraid of parasites.
