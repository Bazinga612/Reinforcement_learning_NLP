Bot_none_15:04:09:Hi,Whasup?
User_none_15:04:09:I love walking along the beach.
Bot_Answer.joking_15:04:09:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
User_Answer.joking_15:04:09:Speaking of cars, I'm thinking of getting a new one.
Bot_Answer.joking_15:04:09:It feels like the fast talking salesmen are always trying to get me to buy something I didn't think I wanted.
User_Answer.joking_15:04:09:But I understand what you mean. Before you know it a slick salesman will have you getting things that you will never use like a ski rack in southern California.
Bot_Answer.continuation_15:04:09:Yea, thats happened to the best of us. Sales men know how to sell.
