Bot_none_15:04:11:Hi,Whasup?
User_none_15:04:11:I love walking along the beach.
Bot_Answer.joking_15:04:11:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
User_Answer.elaboration_15:04:11:I also like going to lakes.
Bot_Answer.continuation_15:04:11:Lakes are pretty nice, especially if you can go out on a boat.
User_Answer.continuation_15:04:11:Yeah, I love boating. I just love the water in general, actually. I like boating, canoing, wake-boarding, scuba diving. Anything in the water, I'm cool with it.
Bot_Answer.continuation_15:04:11:Do you still enjoy tubing? You used to go all the time.
