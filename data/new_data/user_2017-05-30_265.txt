Bot_none_15:04:10:Hi,Whasup?
User_none_15:04:10:I love walking along the beach.
Bot_Answer.joking_15:04:10:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
User_Answer.comments_15:04:10:Sand is interesting; There's so much of it, and we don't even notice it unless there's a lot of it in one place.
Bot_Answer.elaboration_15:04:10:I went to the beach on saturday. There was this kid who built an amazing sand castle
User_Answer.elaboration_15:04:10:I have seen some talented creations made of sand that even involved seashells.
Bot_Answer.change_15:04:10:I was watching this documentary the other day about this festival in Iceland where they have all sorts of crazy sculptures made out of ice.
