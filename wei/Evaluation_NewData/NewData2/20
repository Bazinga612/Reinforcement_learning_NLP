user_prompt:I love walking along the beach.
bot_joking:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
user_change:Speaking of the beach, I love skinny dipping. It's so fun, if you don't get caught. Have you ever been skinny dipping? It doesn't have to be at the beach. Could be a pool or anywhere. Have you done it?
bot_elaboration:I have to be with people I really trust. I like to go way out into a lake, where you can't touch the bottom, and take off my swimsuit. The water all over, with no cloth in between it and my body, is really sensuous.
user_elaboration:It's such a freeing feeling to glide through the water and feel it sliding past your body.
bot_joking:Yea, cold water on me. Great!
