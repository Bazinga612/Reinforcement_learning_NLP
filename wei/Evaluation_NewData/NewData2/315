bot_joking:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
user_continuation:Yeah, I "love" having to vacuum my car.
bot_continuation:I love vacuuming my car too, haha, but it's worth it for all the fun we've had.
user_elaboration:My family used to spend weeks camping along one beach or another.
bot_elaboration:Yea, there are lots of great beaches out there.
