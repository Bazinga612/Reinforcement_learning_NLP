user_prompt:I love walking along the beach.
bot_joking:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
user_continuation:I mean, I do love the beach too, seriously, but cleaning out your car afterwards is a pain. That sand has a way of getting down in between your seats, and in tiny cracks that are hard to clean out. Not to be a pessimist or anything, though! The beach is nice, seriously. Just don't like when you leave!
bot_elaboration:I remember two years ago we went to Virginia Beach, and we had sand in our car for six months after that.
user_continuation:I know what you mean, you can clean your car forever and the sand just won't come out.  I have found that the best thing to do is try a commercial vacuum at the car wash.  Have you tried that?
bot_change:My neighbor's kids are doing some kind of charity car wash for their school this weekend, they made me promise I'd bring mine.
