user_prompt:I love walking along the beach.
bot_joking:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
user_elaboration:I also like going to lakes.
bot_continuation:Lakes are pretty nice, especially if you can go out on a boat.
user_joking:Yeah, that's good thinking there. I was wondering why, when I go out without a boat, I always get drenched. That really had me stumped, but wow, I think you figured it out. You're a smart one, huh?
bot_change:I love boating.
