user_prompt:I love walking along the beach.
bot_joking:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
user_continuation:On the plus side, after a few trips you can make your kids a sandbox.
bot_change:Maybe I should build the kids a tree house. We've got a big tree in the back yard with some nice large low-hanging branches. How hard do you think that would be?
user_elaboration:I hope your kids can have the same fond memories that I did of playing in one.
bot_continuation:What were some of the cool things in your treehouse?
