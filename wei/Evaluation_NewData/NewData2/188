user_prompt:I love walking along the beach.
bot_joking:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
user_change:Oh yeah. It's like you take some of the beach home with you!
bot_elaboration:Yes, because you have the beach and the ocean seemingly to yourself.
user_elaboration:The feeling of being alone at the beach is extremely relaxing. I often feel like none of my worldly cares matter for a few moments.
bot_joking:At least until the tide comes up and you get wet!
