user_prompt:I love walking along the beach.
bot_joking:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
user_continuation:I mean, I do love the beach too, seriously, but cleaning out your car afterwards is a pain. That sand has a way of getting down in between your seats, and in tiny cracks that are hard to clean out. Not to be a pessimist or anything, though! The beach is nice, seriously. Just don't like when you leave!
bot_change:Yeah but speaking of sand, there's something so comforting about it. It reminds me of visiting Florida to see my grandma as a kid.
user_continuation:That must have been a lot of fun visiting your grandma, what else did you guys do besides go to the beach?
bot_elaboration:We just enjoyed life. Ate, talked, played.
