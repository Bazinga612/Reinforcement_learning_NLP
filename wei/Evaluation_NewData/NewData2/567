user_prompt:I love walking along the beach.
bot_joking:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
user_change:But the seagulls  pooping everywhere makes it a little gross.
bot_elaboration:The sand feels good as it squishes between your toes.
user_elaboration:And the water can rush over your feet every now and then, that's nice, too.
bot_elaboration:Yea, I love it when the water is nice and warm too.
