user_prompt:I love walking along the beach.
bot_joking:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
user_joking:Speaking of cars, I'm thinking of getting a new one.
bot_change:I think it won't be too much longer until we can all get self-driving functionality in our cars.
user_elaboration:Probably. I think I'll miss driving myself once everything gets fully automated, especially out on the open road where you can really feel in control. Maybe I should get something sporty while I've still got time.
bot_continuation:Sports cars are the best. I feel so free and open when I get to drive my brother's Mazda.
