user_prompt:I love walking along the beach.
bot_joking:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
user_change:Oh yeah. It's like you take some of the beach home with you!
bot_continuation:My favorite time to walk the beach is early in the morning.
user_continuation:My favorite time to walk along the beach is at night. The sunsets make me feel so beautiful and peaceful, and since I'm an introvert, it's a good way to get some alone time.
bot_joking:I am not much of a morning person either so the beach gives me an incentive to keep from sleeping till noon.
