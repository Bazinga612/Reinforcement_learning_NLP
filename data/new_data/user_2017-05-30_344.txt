User_none_15:04:11:I love walking along the beach.
Bot_Answer.joking_15:04:11:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
User_Answer.elaboration_15:04:11:I also like going to lakes.
Bot_Answer.elaboration_15:04:11:The beach reminds me of a peaceful place
User_Answer.elaboration_15:04:11:I feel like we can feel so rested at the beach because it calms all of our senses. We can touch the sand, hear the waves, smell the salt. All we have to do is buy a treat to eat and we have calming input coming into all of our senses!
Bot_Answer.joking_15:04:11:Yea, thats really relaxing.... NOT
