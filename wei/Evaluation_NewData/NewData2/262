user_prompt:I love walking along the beach.
bot_joking:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
user_continuation:Sand is interesting; There's so much of it, and we don't even notice it unless there's a lot of it in one place.
bot_elaboration:I went to the beach on saturday. There was this kid who built an amazing sand castle
user_change:It's going to rain tomorrow I heard, so they'll be gone.
bot_continuation:I always hated making a great castle only to see it ruined. I used to get pictures of them at least.
