Bot_none_15:04:11:Hi,Whasup?
User_none_15:04:11:I love walking along the beach.
Bot_Answer.joking_15:04:11:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
User_Answer.joking_15:04:11:The sound of the surf is my favorite part.
Bot_Answer.change_15:04:11:I prefer the ocean though. There's something magical about the cool water.
User_Answer.change_15:04:11:Sometimes I feel like I am at peace with everything when I'm standing in the surf.
Bot_Answer.continuation_15:04:11:Yea, standing on that board is just peaceful.
