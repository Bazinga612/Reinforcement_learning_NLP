user_prompt:I love walking along the beach.
bot_joking:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
user_change:Oh yeah. It's like you take some of the beach home with you!
bot_elaboration:Yes, because you have the beach and the ocean seemingly to yourself.
user_joking:If I had my own private beach I think the best thing about it would be the chance to stride up to somebody and tell them to get off my island!
bot_continuation:Having your own beach would be awesome, you'd get all the benefits without the hassles of getting back and forth.
