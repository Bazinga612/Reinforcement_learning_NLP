bot_joking:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
user_change:But the seagulls  pooping everywhere makes it a little gross.
bot_elaboration:The sand feels good as it squishes between your toes.
user_change:Sometime I think about maybe getting a boat, I bet that's fun, too.
bot_joking:oh sure . Magellan you are not  !!!  :)
