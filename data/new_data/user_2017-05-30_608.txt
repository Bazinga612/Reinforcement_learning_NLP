User_none_15:04:12:I love walking along the beach.
Bot_Answer.joking_15:04:12:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
User_Answer.comments_15:04:12:On the plus side, after a few trips you can make your kids a sandbox.
Bot_Answer.elaboration_15:04:12:Collecting sea shells is another exciting activity at the beach.
User_Answer.elaboration_15:04:12:Sea shells are so pretty and make a great decoration in your house.
Bot_Answer.joking_15:04:12:Yea, sea shells sure are the best?
