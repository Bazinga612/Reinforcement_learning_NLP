Bot_none_15:04:09:Hi,Whasup?
User_none_15:04:09:I love walking along the beach.
Bot_Answer.joking_15:04:09:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
User_Answer.joking_15:04:09:Speaking of cars, I'm thinking of getting a new one.
Bot_Answer.continuation_15:04:09:I'd like to get a new car, but I need to coax a few more years out of the one I've got to make it worth what I paid for it.
User_Answer.continuation_15:04:09:I have a whole calendar of scheduled maintenance that I will need to follow up on to keep my new car healthy.
Bot_Answer.continuation_15:04:09:I suppose that's better than having to deal with unexpected breakdowns.
