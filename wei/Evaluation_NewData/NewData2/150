user_prompt:I love walking along the beach.
bot_joking:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
user_change:Oh yeah. It's like you take some of the beach home with you!
bot_change:Hey, I found a gold coin once while walking on the beach.
user_continuation:Really? That's amazing. The most interesting thing I've ever found is cool-looking shells.
bot_continuation:Yeah. I was just walking and hit something with my foot. I would have kept on going but I noticed something shiny when I looked down so I stopped and picked it up.
