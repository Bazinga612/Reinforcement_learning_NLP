Bot_none_15:04:12:Hi,Whasup?
User_none_15:04:12:I love walking along the beach.
Bot_Answer.joking_15:04:12:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
User_Answer.joking_15:04:12:The sound of the surf is my favorite part.
Bot_Answer.change_15:04:12:Speaking of sound have you tried holding a shell to your ear?
User_Answer.change_15:04:12:I also like to check out pools in the summer, sometimes it's nice not to have to deal with the sand.
Bot_Answer.continuation_15:04:12:Sometimes its nice to be able to dry off and go right home.
