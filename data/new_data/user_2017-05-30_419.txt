Bot_none_15:04:11:Hi,Whasup?
User_none_15:04:11:I love walking along the beach.
Bot_Answer.joking_15:04:11:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
User_Answer.elaboration_15:04:11:I also like going to lakes.
Bot_Answer.elaboration_15:04:11:Lakes always remind me of the times my Dad took me fishing.
User_Answer.elaboration_15:04:11:We would sit for hours gently rocking back and forth in a small fishing boat.
Bot_Answer.elaboration_15:04:11:We had a little rowboat that we would take sometimes. Honestly I had more fun rowing the boat than I did with the fishing.
