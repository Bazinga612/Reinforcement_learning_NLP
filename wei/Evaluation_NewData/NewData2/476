bot_joking:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
user_joking:The sound of the surf is my favorite part.

user_continuation:If I wasn't concerned about getting too much sun I'd like to just lie down there and let it lull me to sleep.
bot_joking:That's why you need to get someone to bury you in the sand first. And if it's someone nice they'll even do it above the high tide line.
