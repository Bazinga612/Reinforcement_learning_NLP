user_prompt:I love walking along the beach.
bot_joking:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
user_elaboration:I also like going to lakes.
bot_change:Actually, lakes can have some weird stuff in them. Have you ever stepped on anything squirmy in the lake? I hear they've got eels and bloodsuckers, icky.
user_elaboration:I really like water skiing when I visit the lake.  It scary and fun at the same time.
bot_change:I love to jump in pools.
