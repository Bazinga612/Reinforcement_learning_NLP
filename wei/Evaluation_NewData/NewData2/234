user_prompt:I love walking along the beach.
bot_joking:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
user_continuation:Sand is interesting; There's so much of it, and we don't even notice it unless there's a lot of it in one place.
bot_change:Although this time of year, getting stuff in your eye can be a big problem. Do you suffer from hay fever? Pollen, now that's a killer. And I'll be there's more pollen in this world than grains of sand.
user_joking:And don't you hate it when you have to give a speech and your nose is clogged and you end up sounding like donold duck?
bot_continuation:Oh my gosh, yes.  I used to get horrible sinus infections as a kid.
