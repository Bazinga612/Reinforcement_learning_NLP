Bot_none_15:04:09:Hi,Whasup?
User_none_15:04:09:I love walking along the beach.
Bot_Answer.joking_15:04:09:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
User_Answer.change_15:04:09:Oh yeah. It's like you take some of the beach home with you!
Bot_Answer.elaboration_15:04:09:If you get enough stuff you could even use it to make a beach scene in your backyard. Just don't take anything illegal. In some places it's illegal to take seashells.
User_Answer.elaboration_15:04:09:I wonder why exactly it's illegal. I mean, it's not like the seashells are being used anymore.
Bot_Answer.continuation_15:04:09:Yea, that is true. It really shouldn't be illegal.
