Bot_none_15:04:11:Hi,Whasup?
User_none_15:04:11:I love walking along the beach.
Bot_Answer.joking_15:04:11:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
User_Answer.elaboration_15:04:11:I also like going to lakes.
Bot_Answer.elaboration_15:04:11:Lakes always remind me of the times my Dad took me fishing.
User_Answer.elaboration_15:04:11:If a fish did hit my fishing line, the shock would make me almost jump out of the boat.
Bot_Answer.change_15:04:11:Yeah, did you ever want to dive into large bodies of water? I get heebie jeebies whenever I imagine falling out of a boat. High diving is just creepy.
