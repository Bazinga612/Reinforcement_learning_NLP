Bot_none_15:04:09:Hi,Whasup?
User_none_15:04:09:I love walking along the beach.
Bot_Answer.joking_15:04:09:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
User_Answer.continuation_15:04:09:I mean, I do love the beach too, seriously, but cleaning out your car afterwards is a pain. That sand has a way of getting down in between your seats, and in tiny cracks that are hard to clean out. Not to be a pessimist or anything, though! The beach is nice, seriously. Just don't like when you leave!
Bot_Answer.continuation_15:04:09:I agree. I hate leaving the beach as well. Not only do you have the thought of a fun time that's now over, you've got a hole bunch of cleaning up to do.
User_Answer.continuation_15:04:09:Totally, but what do you think about the mountains? Have you ever gone hiking?
Bot_Answer.joking_15:04:09:I'd fall down the side of one and end up having to live in a cave.
