Bot_none_15:04:09:Hi,Whasup?
User_none_15:04:09:I love walking along the beach.
Bot_Answer.joking_15:04:09:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
User_Answer.joking_15:04:09:Speaking of cars, I'm thinking of getting a new one.
Bot_Answer.elaboration_15:04:09:My family has always traded classic cars and I've seen a hundred deals and still it feels intimidating to purchase one.
User_Answer.elaboration_15:04:09:Purchasing a new car can be one of the most intimidating things.
Bot_Answer.elaboration_15:04:09:The people that sell them have so much more information that it always feels like they have the advantage.
