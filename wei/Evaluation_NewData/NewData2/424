user_prompt:I love walking along the beach.
bot_joking:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
user_elaboration:I also like going to lakes.
bot_elaboration:Lakes always remind me of the times my Dad took me fishing.
user_joking:If a fish did hit my fishing line, the shock would make me almost jump out of the boat.
bot_joking:Imagine what would happen if you reeled in a boot.
