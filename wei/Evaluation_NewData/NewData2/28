user_prompt:I love walking along the beach.
bot_joking:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
user_continuation:I mean, I do love the beach too, seriously, but cleaning out your car afterwards is a pain. That sand has a way of getting down in between your seats, and in tiny cracks that are hard to clean out. Not to be a pessimist or anything, though! The beach is nice, seriously. Just don't like when you leave!
bot_change:My favorite activity after going to the beach is to take a long hot bath. Though I don't get the opportunity often, there's something relaxing about baths.
user_elaboration:A bath is a nice thing after the beach because the beach can actually be quite a pain. After cleaning the sand off of everything you deserve to relax!
bot_joking:Yes, after stressing furiously at the beach, one must relieve themselves of that stress with a nice bath.
