user_prompt:I love walking along the beach.
bot_joking:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
user_change:But the seagulls  pooping everywhere makes it a little gross.
bot_elaboration:The sand feels good as it squishes between your toes.
user_joking:I try to squish the seagulls between my toes but they're too quick for me.
bot_continuation:Well walking on sand is all strength-training for your feet and calves, you need to mix it up if you want speed and agility.
