Bot_none_15:04:09:Hi,Whasup?
User_none_15:04:09:I love walking along the beach.
Bot_Answer.joking_15:04:09:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
User_Answer.joking_15:04:09:Speaking of cars, I'm thinking of getting a new one.
Bot_Answer.elaboration_15:04:09:My family has always traded classic cars and I've seen a hundred deals and still it feels intimidating to purchase one.
User_Answer.elaboration_15:04:09:I love looking for deals for everything. I got my computer so cheap because of a deal I found online!
Bot_Answer.continuation_15:04:09:The best time to shop online is black Friday. I've gotten multiple computers and devices on sale as much as 50% off, it just requires patience.
