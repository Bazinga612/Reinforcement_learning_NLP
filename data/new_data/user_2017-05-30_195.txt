Bot_none_15:04:09:Hi,Whasup?
User_none_15:04:09:I love walking along the beach.
Bot_Answer.joking_15:04:09:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
User_Answer.change_15:04:09:Oh yeah. It's like you take some of the beach home with you!
Bot_Answer.change_15:04:09:When winter comes, you can decorate your backyard to look like a ski resort! No sand required for that.
User_Answer.change_15:04:09:You totally could. Which reminds me, are you going away at Christmastime this year? I was wondering if you could dog sit for me if you're going to be in town.
Bot_Answer.elaboration_15:04:09:Actually I'm going to see my grandma this year. I'd love to help watch your Rufus, though.
