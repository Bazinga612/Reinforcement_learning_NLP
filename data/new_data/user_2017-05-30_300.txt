Bot_none_15:04:10:Hi,Whasup?
User_none_15:04:10:I love walking along the beach.
Bot_Answer.joking_15:04:10:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
User_Answer.continuation_15:04:10:Yeah, I "love" having to vacuum my car.
Bot_Answer.elaboration_15:04:10:But my kids love the beach, and the back seat gets filled with buckets and shovels and inflatable water toys. It's not just sand.
User_Answer.elaboration_15:04:10:It does have its benefits though. We get a fabulous tan and  playing on the beach wears out the kids. By the time we get home, they are so tired and ready to hit the sack.
Bot_Answer.joking_15:04:10:It's amazing how playing at a beach can tire a kid out, but they seem to have boundless energy when it comes to asking "can we go to the beach?" over and over again.
