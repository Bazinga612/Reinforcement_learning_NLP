Bot_none_15:04:11:Hi,Whasup?
User_none_15:04:11:I love walking along the beach.
Bot_Answer.joking_15:04:11:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
User_Answer.elaboration_15:04:11:I also like going to lakes.
Bot_Answer.elaboration_15:04:11:The beach reminds me of a peaceful place
User_Answer.elaboration_15:04:11:It's the same for me. The beach is a place where I can easily sit and meditate and pray.
Bot_Answer.continuation_15:04:11:It's such as shame that it can be an ordeal getting there and back, though, that takes something away from it.
