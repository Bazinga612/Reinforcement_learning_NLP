user_prompt:I love walking along the beach.
bot_joking:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
user_change:Oh yeah. It's like you take some of the beach home with you!
bot_elaboration:Yes, because you have the beach and the ocean seemingly to yourself.
user_joking:If I had my own private beach I think the best thing about it would be the chance to stride up to somebody and tell them to get off my island!
bot_change:I wish I was rich enough to have beachfront property, but unless I hit the lottery I don't see it happening.
