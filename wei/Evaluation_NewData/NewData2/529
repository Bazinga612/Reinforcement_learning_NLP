user_prompt:I love walking along the beach.
bot_joking:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
user_joking:The sound of the surf is my favorite part.
bot_continuation:Oh the sound is so delightful especially when taking a nap.
user_change:It is, I love when the water is warm around 80 degrees.
bot_change:I remember that one time I thought a shark touched me and it was just some seaweed, but I went running out of the water screaming anyway.
