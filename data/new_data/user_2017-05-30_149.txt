Bot_none_15:04:09:Hi,Whasup?
User_none_15:04:09:I love walking along the beach.
Bot_Answer.joking_15:04:09:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
User_Answer.change_15:04:09:Oh yeah. It's like you take some of the beach home with you!
Bot_Answer.change_15:04:09:Hey, I found a gold coin once while walking on the beach.
User_Answer.change_15:04:09:Really? That's amazing. The most interesting thing I've ever found is cool-looking shells.
Bot_Answer.change_15:04:09:Yeah, I found it, but then my little brother took it and lost it again. He was just a little kid so it's probably not fair to blame him, but I was so mad at the time!
