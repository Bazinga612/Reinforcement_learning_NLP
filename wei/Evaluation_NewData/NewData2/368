user_prompt:I love walking along the beach.
bot_joking:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
user_elaboration:I also like going to lakes.
bot_change:Actually, lakes can have some weird stuff in them. Have you ever stepped on anything squirmy in the lake? I hear they've got eels and bloodsuckers, icky.
user_change:I also like to kayak but for that I prefer the ocean.  Have you tried kayaking?
bot_joking:Yeah, but I think HipMunk is better.
