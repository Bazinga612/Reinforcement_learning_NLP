user_prompt:I love walking along the beach.
bot_joking:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
user_joking:The sound of the surf is my favorite part.
bot_joking:Yeah, "Those waves are gnarly, dude." No, wait, that's the sound of the surfers.
user_change:I'd like to walk around here more, but there's nowhere that you can get away from the sound of traffic, so I can never fully relax.
bot_continuation:Would noise-cancelling headphones work? I haven't tried them myself but I've been meaning to.
