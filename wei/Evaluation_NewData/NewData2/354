user_prompt:I love walking along the beach.
bot_joking:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
user_elaboration:I also like going to lakes.
bot_joking:I wouldn't imagine getting sand in your shoes is very comfortable. But that's all part of the beach experience
user_continuation:It is part of the whole experience, but cleaning the car can really take some time.
bot_continuation:Yes. I normally just use the shop vac and clean everything at once. It saves time that way.
