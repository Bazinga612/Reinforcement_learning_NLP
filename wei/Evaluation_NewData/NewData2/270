user_prompt:I love walking along the beach.
bot_joking:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
user_continuation:Sand is interesting; There's so much of it, and we don't even notice it unless there's a lot of it in one place.
bot_joking:Heck getting sand in your feet is the best part
user_change:I prefer to take long walks on the beach with sandles. Running on the beach is a really good workout because of the resistance of the sand.
bot_continuation:You can run a short distance on the beach, but still get a workout.
