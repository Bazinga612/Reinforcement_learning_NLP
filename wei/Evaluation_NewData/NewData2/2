user_prompt:I love walking along the beach.
bot_joking:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
user_change:Speaking of the beach, I love skinny dipping. It's so fun, if you don't get caught. Have you ever been skinny dipping? It doesn't have to be at the beach. Could be a pool or anywhere. Have you done it?
bot_change:Do you think it is trespassing if at some point they said you could swim there? Like the neighbor said, "Hey come swimming this weekend", just the time you went they did not know?
user_change:I like water parks too.  Have you ever bee to one?  I think they are a lot of fun even though I did have a scary experience at one growing up.
bot_continuation:I've been to a ton! My favorite was in the Wisconsin Dells.
