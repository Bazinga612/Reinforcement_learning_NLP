user_prompt:I love walking along the beach.
bot_joking:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
user_change:Oh yeah. It's like you take some of the beach home with you!
bot_elaboration:If you get enough stuff you could even use it to make a beach scene in your backyard. Just don't take anything illegal. In some places it's illegal to take seashells.
user_joking:I dropped a seashell in my bag by accident once when I was at the beach, and I panicked as I was leaving when I noticed it, and I had to frantically run and put it back. The lifeguards were laughing so hard.
bot_joking:I bet they thought you were a real criminal!
