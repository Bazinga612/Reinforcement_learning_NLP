user_prompt:I love walking along the beach.
bot_joking:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
user_joking:The sound of the surf is my favorite part.
bot_continuation:Oh the sound is so delightful especially when taking a nap.
user_joking:Yes, until you fall sound asleep and the waves crash down on you cause you did not hear them.
bot_continuation:I know I went on a trip to a rental house on the coast and it was very peaceful and relaxing to hear the waves at night.
