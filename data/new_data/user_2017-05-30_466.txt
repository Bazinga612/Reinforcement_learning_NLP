Bot_none_15:04:11:Hi,Whasup?
User_none_15:04:11:I love walking along the beach.
Bot_Answer.joking_15:04:11:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
User_Answer.joking_15:04:11:The sound of the surf is my favorite part.
Bot_Answer.change_15:04:11:I like the sound of flowing water, but I prefer a fountain or a babbling brook.
User_Answer.change_15:04:11:I like the sound of the ocean. It sounds so big, which makes me feel like my problems are smaller by comparison.
Bot_Answer.continuation_15:04:11:And thinking how much water there is on the horizon makes me feel small, too.
