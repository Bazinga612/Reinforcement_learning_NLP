Bot_none_15:04:09:Hi,Whasup?
User_none_15:04:09:I love walking along the beach.
Bot_Answer.joking_15:04:09:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
User_Answer.joking_15:04:09:Speaking of cars, I'm thinking of getting a new one.
Bot_Answer.change_15:04:09:I think it won't be too much longer until we can all get self-driving functionality in our cars.
User_Answer.change_15:04:09:It's kind of strange how technology turns out. Way back when they thought we'd all be controlling our own flying cars, but it turns out that we're going to have computers drive us around on the ground.
Bot_Answer.continuation_15:04:09:Yea, computers can do it all these days.
