user_prompt:I love walking along the beach.
bot_joking:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
user_continuation:I mean, I do love the beach too, seriously, but cleaning out your car afterwards is a pain. That sand has a way of getting down in between your seats, and in tiny cracks that are hard to clean out. Not to be a pessimist or anything, though! The beach is nice, seriously. Just don't like when you leave!
bot_continuation:I agree. I hate leaving the beach as well. Not only do you have the thought of a fun time that's now over, you've got a hole bunch of cleaning up to do.
user_continuation:Yes, not to mention the unpacking and laundry that has to be done too.
bot_elaboration:Yea, somebody has to do it  though.
