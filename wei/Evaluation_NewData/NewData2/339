user_prompt:I love walking along the beach.
bot_joking:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
user_elaboration:I also like going to lakes.
bot_elaboration:The beach reminds me of a peaceful place
user_continuation:It's the same for me. The beach is a place where I can easily sit and meditate and pray.
bot_elaboration:If there was a way to get the peacefulness and the serenity without the hassles that would be great. But I think whatever they'd do to make that work would mess up the good parts.
