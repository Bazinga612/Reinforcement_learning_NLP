bot_joking:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
user_joking:The sound of the surf is my favorite part.
bot_continuation:Oh the sound is so delightful especially when taking a nap.
user_continuation:Me, too although not when the sand is hot. That is why I walk near the water.
bot_continuation:Beaches are just the ultimate getaway.
