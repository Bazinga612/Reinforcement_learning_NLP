user_prompt:I love walking along the beach.
bot_joking:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
user_continuation:On the plus side, after a few trips you can make your kids a sandbox.
bot_change:Maybe I should build the kids a tree house. We've got a big tree in the back yard with some nice large low-hanging branches. How hard do you think that would be?
user_continuation:It depends on the age of the tree and what kinds of permits you might have to file. My grand father built me a treehouse and each year he'd expand it as his gift to me.
bot_joking:Did it ever fall?
