user_prompt:I love walking along the beach.
bot_joking:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
user_continuation:Yeah, I "love" having to vacuum my car.
bot_elaboration:Every time I'm standing on the beach at sunset though, I see why people do it. Even with the sand in your stuff and on your clothes it's still a magical experience.
user_elaboration:Not to mention being barefoot - sinking into the wet sand, makes you feel one with the earth.
bot_change:I love being on the beach.
