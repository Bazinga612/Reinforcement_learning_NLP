user_prompt:I love walking along the beach.
bot_joking:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
user_continuation:Sand is interesting; There's so much of it, and we don't even notice it unless there's a lot of it in one place.
bot_change:Although this time of year, getting stuff in your eye can be a big problem. Do you suffer from hay fever? Pollen, now that's a killer. And I'll be there's more pollen in this world than grains of sand.
user_continuation:I feel for people with allergies. It's hard to hide from something that you're allergic to when it's in the air everywhere.
bot_continuation:Yea, I do not enjoy sneezing all the time.
