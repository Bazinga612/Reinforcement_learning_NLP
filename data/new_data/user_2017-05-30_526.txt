Bot_none_15:04:12:Hi,Whasup?
User_none_15:04:12:I love walking along the beach.
Bot_Answer.joking_15:04:12:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
User_Answer.joking_15:04:12:The sound of the surf is my favorite part.
Bot_Answer.change_15:04:12:Speaking of sound have you tried holding a shell to your ear?
User_Answer.change_15:04:12:How about all the sand in the car after the beach?  That's no fun at all!
Bot_Answer.continuation_15:04:12:I know you're not supposed to take shells from the beach but it's so cool to bring the sound of the ocean home with you. I had to study why it sounds that way but can't remember what I learned.
