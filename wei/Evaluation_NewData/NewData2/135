user_prompt:I love walking along the beach.
bot_joking:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
user_joking:Speaking of cars, I'm thinking of getting a new one.
bot_elaboration:I like having a new car, but I hate shopping for them, and I especially hate dealing with the sales people.
user_change:I don't mind boat shopping as much though. There's just something engaging about the diversity of boat models that makes shopping for them a lot more enjoyable.
bot_elaboration:What boat are you gonna buy now? A bigger one?
