Bot_none_15:04:09:Hi,Whasup?
User_none_15:04:09:I love walking along the beach.
Bot_Answer.joking_15:04:09:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
User_Answer.continuation_15:04:09:I mean, I do love the beach too, seriously, but cleaning out your car afterwards is a pain. That sand has a way of getting down in between your seats, and in tiny cracks that are hard to clean out. Not to be a pessimist or anything, though! The beach is nice, seriously. Just don't like when you leave!
Bot_Answer.elaboration_15:04:09:I remember two years ago we went to Virginia Beach, and we had sand in our car for six months after that.
User_Answer.elaboration_15:04:09:I love Virginia Beach and have been there many time  My favorite beaches on the East Coast are up north in Cape Cod, those beaches are beautiful.
Bot_Answer.continuation_15:04:09:Those beaches are amazing and not usually all that crowded.
