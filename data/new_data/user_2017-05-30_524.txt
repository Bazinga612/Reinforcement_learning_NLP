Bot_none_15:04:12:Hi,Whasup?
User_none_15:04:12:I love walking along the beach.
Bot_Answer.joking_15:04:12:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
User_Answer.joking_15:04:12:The sound of the surf is my favorite part.
Bot_Answer.change_15:04:12:Speaking of sound have you tried holding a shell to your ear?
User_Answer.change_15:04:12:I also love the sound of the surf especially because it may mean that there are big waves.
Bot_Answer.joking_15:04:12:I just love being tackled by waves.
