Bot_negative_15:37:34:I don't like the slave masters, they should die soon.
molly_None_15:37:39:from what I see in previous season, some died some are alive and serve the mother of dargon.
Bot_opinion_15:37:39:If they want to serve the queen, they must set the slaves free.
molly_None_15:37:59:yes, they did, even though some of them are pretending their loyalty.
Bot_elaborate_15:37:59:Can you tell me more? How they pretend on it?
molly_None_15:38:04:They are just afraid of the dragons, not her.
Bot_elaborate_15:38:04:what do you mean?
molly_None_15:38:09:Only when the dragons fight with Dennis, the slave masters are getting worried. They are not afraid of her army.
Bot_affirmative_15:38:09:You are smart to see that. I totally agree with you.
molly_None_15:38:17:okay, thanks. Do you think the dragon fire could kill white walkers?
Bot_elaborate_15:38:17:can you tell me something could kill White walkers?
molly_None_15:38:23:yeah, the dragon glass, and swards.
Bot_elaborate_15:38:23:What do you mean?
molly_None_15:38:30:the night watchesâ€™s sword and the dragon glass could kill them, as what we saw.
