Bot_none_15:04:10:Hi,Whasup?
User_none_15:04:10:I love walking along the beach.
Bot_Answer.joking_15:04:10:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
User_Answer.comments_15:04:10:Sand is interesting; There's so much of it, and we don't even notice it unless there's a lot of it in one place.
Bot_Answer.joking_15:04:10:In the sand is also a nice place to get romantic.
User_Answer.joking_15:04:10:Some of my best romantic memories are beach picnics.
Bot_Answer.elaboration_15:04:10:I prefer to swim and play around on the beach instead of just sitting around.
