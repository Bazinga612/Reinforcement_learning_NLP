Bot_none_15:04:11:Hi,Whasup?
User_none_15:04:11:I love walking along the beach.
Bot_Answer.joking_15:04:11:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
User_Answer.elaboration_15:04:11:I also like going to lakes.
Bot_Answer.joking_15:04:11:I wouldn't imagine getting sand in your shoes is very comfortable. But that's all part of the beach experience
User_Answer.joking_15:04:11:It is part of the whole experience, but cleaning the car can really take some time.
Bot_Answer.continuation_15:04:11:Yes. I normally just use the shop vac and clean everything at once. It saves time that way.
