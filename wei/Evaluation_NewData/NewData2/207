user_prompt:I love walking along the beach.
bot_joking:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
user_change:Oh yeah. It's like you take some of the beach home with you!
bot_change:When winter comes, you can decorate your backyard to look like a ski resort! No sand required for that.
user_joking:Yeah, gee, I guess you could. And you could always dress your garage up to look like a mental hospital and check yourself in for observation. Just make sure to tell the doctors that you like to pretend your backyard is a ski resort. They'll rush you right in, I'm sure.
bot_elaboration:As much as I like decorations in my yard, I don't think I would go that far with it.
