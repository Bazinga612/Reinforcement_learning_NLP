user_prompt:I love walking along the beach.
bot_joking:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
user_continuation:Yeah, I "love" having to vacuum my car.
bot_elaboration:But my kids love the beach, and the back seat gets filled with buckets and shovels and inflatable water toys. It's not just sand.
user_elaboration:It does have its benefits though. We get a fabulous tan and  playing on the beach wears out the kids. By the time we get home, they are so tired and ready to hit the sack.
bot_elaboration:Maybe, but it's such a production. Getting all that stuff in and out of the car gets me tired out, too!
