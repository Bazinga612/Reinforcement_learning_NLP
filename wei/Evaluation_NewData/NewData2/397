user_prompt:I love walking along the beach.
bot_joking:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
user_elaboration:I also like going to lakes.
bot_continuation:Lakes are pretty nice, especially if you can go out on a boat.
user_change:Yeah, I like outdoor things in general. I'm a big fan of camping out, too. Not many people are, it seems, but I love a night in the woods in a tent, campfire, the whole nine yards.
bot_change:I like camping, but I would rather have a camper, not a tent. I like having a door to close at night.
