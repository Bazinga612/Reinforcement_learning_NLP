Bot_none_15:04:11:Hi,Whasup?
User_none_15:04:11:I love walking along the beach.
Bot_Answer.joking_15:04:11:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
User_Answer.continuation_15:04:11:Yeah, I "love" having to vacuum my car.
Bot_Answer.continuation_15:04:11:I love vacuuming my car too, haha, but it's worth it for all the fun we've had.
User_Answer.continuation_15:04:11:My family used to spend weeks camping along one beach or another.
Bot_Answer.joking_15:04:11:Who wouldn't wanna sleep on the sand?
