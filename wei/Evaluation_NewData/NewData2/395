user_prompt:I love walking along the beach.
bot_joking:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
user_elaboration:I also like going to lakes.
bot_elaboration:You can do a lot of the same things in a lake as in the ocean, except maybe surfing. If the lake is big enough, you can go sail boating, and they have these new boards now you can stand on and paddle your way around.
user_elaboration:My favorite thing to a the lake near me is canoeing.  Every once and a while the park offers sunset canoe trips.  It is so peaceful and beautiful to be out on the lake at the end of the day.
bot_elaboration:I did like paddling in the quiet. I'd love to go again.
