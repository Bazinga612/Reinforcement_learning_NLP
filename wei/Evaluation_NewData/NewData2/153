user_prompt:I love walking along the beach.
bot_joking:I love the beach. I especially love how the sand sticks to your feet, and when you leave you get a car full of sand to remind you of how much you love the beach.
user_change:Oh yeah. It's like you take some of the beach home with you!
bot_change:Hey, I found a gold coin once while walking on the beach.
user_elaboration:Wow. I sometimes see people with metal detectors there, but I figured that nobody ever actually finds anything worthwhile.
bot_change:Yes, it's quite hard, like a needle in a haystack. But a lot of things are like that. I used to be a bird watcher, and it would take me years to find specific birds that were supposed to be at the beach.
